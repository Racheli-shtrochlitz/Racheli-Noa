# Healthy Recipes App (React)

A simple React application for managing and viewing healthy recipes. Users can add new recipes and mark recipes as favorites. All data is stored in-memory â€” no backend or database integration.

## Features

- Add new recipes with title, ingredients, instructions and image
- Mark/unmark recipes as favorites
- View list of all recipes and filter by favorites

## Technologies

- React (Functional Components, Hooks)
- HTML/CSS
- In-memory state management (useState)

## Limitations

- No backend: all data is lost on page refresh
- No persistent storage (no database or API)

## How to Run

Run the following commands:

npm install  
npm start

Then open your browser at: http://localhost:3000


## Future Improvements

- Add persistent storage (e.g., localStorage or backend)
- Implement search and category filters
- Improve UI/UX with animations or design framework
